# qwakes

The `qwakes` package simulates stock market data using [Q-Hawkes processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07710) and provides tools for statistical inference and backtesting of portfolio strategies. The package is written primarily in Go and uses the [stochadex](https://github.com/umbralcalc/stochadex) engine to power all of the essential tooling.
